Event page:
    calendar and links to what events are coming up

Lot Page: 
    clickable lot map that gives information on the lot 
        public (address)
        private, members only (name, phone, email whatever user wants made public)
        able to log in and logins are only for residents, need to figure out how to prove (dl? or piece of mail? or just conversation?  Maybe during a community meeting codes can be handed out to use to sign up and the code must coorispond to the lot)
